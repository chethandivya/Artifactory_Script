//Shell script to download from Jfrog to VMs

Sure, you can use a shell script to download artifacts from JFrog Artifactory to your VM servers. Here’s a basic example of how you might do this using curl. This script assumes that you have curl installed on your VM and that you’re using Artifactory’s REST API:

#!/bin/bash

# Variables
ARTIFACTORY_URL="https://your.artifactory.server/artifactory"
REPO_KEY="your-repo-key"
ARTIFACT_PATH="path/to/your/artifact"
TARGET_DIR="/path/to/target/directory"
USER="your-username"
API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Construct the URL
URL="${ARTIFACTORY_URL}/${REPO_KEY}/${ARTIFACT_PATH}"

# Download the artifact
curl -u${USER}:${API_KEY} -O ${URL} -o ${TARGET_DIR}

echo "Download complete!"

Please replace "https://your.artifactory.server/artifactory", "your-repo-key", "path/to/your/artifact", "/path/to/target/directory", "your-username", and "your-api-key" with your actual Artifactory URL, repository key, artifact path, target directory, username, and API key respectively.

This script will download the specified artifact from Artifactory and save it to the specified directory on your VM.

Please note that this is a basic example and might need to be adjusted based on your specific needs and environment. Always test scripts in a safe and recoverable environment before deploying them. Also, remember to handle your credentials securely.
